The numerical results present demonstrations of the ordinary state-based (OSB) PeriDynamic (PD) theory, PeriDynamic Differential Operator (PDDO), and Nonlocal Operator Method (NOM) computer codes for predicting deformation and material failure. Numerical results concern first the validation of OSB PD by capturing the displacement fields and crack propagation in a plate with a pre-existing crack subjected to quasi-static displacement constraints under plane stress conditions. Subsequently, Timoshenko's cantilever beam problem is considered as a benchmark for validating PDDO and NOM.
